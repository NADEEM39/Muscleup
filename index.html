  </div>
  <div class="aboutabs">
      <p>
        TThe teres muscles are two small muscles located in the upper back and shoulder region.
        They are known as the teres major and teres minor.</p>
        <p>The teres major is a larger muscle that runs along the lateral border of the scapula (shoulder blade) and attaches to the humerus bone in the upper arm.
        <p>The teres minor is a smaller muscle located just above the teres major.
            It also attaches to the scapula and inserts into the humerus.
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="absexc">
  
      <h4>The Best Teres Exercises: </h4>
  
      <h4>(A)Rows (Various Types):</h4>
          <li>Exercises like bent-over rows, seated rows, and cable rows engage the muscles of the upper back, which can include the teres major and teres minor. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together during the pulling motion to activate these muscles.</li>
  
          <h4>(B) Lat Pulldowns:</h4>
  
          <li>Lat pulldowns primarily target the latissimus dorsi muscles but also engage the muscles of the upper back, including the teres muscles. Ensure proper scapular retraction during the movement to involve the teres muscles more effectively.</li>
          
  
  
          <h4>(C)External Rotation Exercises:</h4>
  
          <li>External rotation exercises, often performed with resistance bands or light dumbbells, can engage the teres minor, which is involved in external rotation of the arm. Examples include lying external rotations and standing band external rotations.</li>

          <h4>(D)Face Pulls:</h4>

          <li>Face pulls with a rope attachment on a cable machine can help engage the rear deltoids, traps, and other upper back muscles, potentially including the teres muscles. Focus on pulling the rope towards your face while keeping your elbows high.</li>
